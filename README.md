# UE5-NetDormancy-Demo
This is a simple Unreal Engine 5 project that demonstrates how to use **Net Dormancy** to optimize network replication for actors in multiplayer games.

üß™ What This Project Shows

This project includes two test cases:

1. **Explosive Barrels (Always Awake)**
   - Barrels are set to replicate constantly using `NetDormancy = Awake`.
   - Even while idle, they continue sending data over the network.
   - When damaged, they explode and spawn cosmetic effects.

2. **Explosive Barrels (DormantAll)**
   - Barrels start with `NetDormancy = DormantAll`.
   - They send no updates over the network until they take damage.
   - On impact, they wake up from dormancy, replicate effects, and get destroyed.

These two setups are analyzed using **Unreal's Network Profiler**, showing the difference in replication cost and network waste.

## üì¶ Push-Based Replication

This project also uses **Push-Based Replication**, which helps reduce bandwidth by only replicating variables when explicitly marked as "dirty".

### üîß How to Enable Push Replication

To enable push-based replication in your project, you must add `NetCore` as a dependency module in your `YourProject.Build.cs` file.

PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {
    "Core",
    "CoreUObject",
    "Engine",
    "InputCore",
    "EnhancedInput",
    "UMG",
    "NetCore" // necessary for push replication
});
